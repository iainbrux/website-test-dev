                        <br>

                        This is my digital portfolio website, and in the portfolio
                    section you will find numerous projects that showcase
                my learning path to my current skillset I have obtained.
                        <br><br>
                        I am continuing daily to complete the full stack syllabus
                        via The Odin Project and my portfolio section will be continuously
                        updated as I start and complete personal and set projects.
                        <br><br>
                        I have an active interest in the computer sciences behind cryptocurrency,
                        but I also enjoy creating game mods on PC for games like Counter-Strike and
                        through tinkering and editing since I was about 13 years old I have developed a
                        deep passion and love for coding.
